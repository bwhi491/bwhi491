### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  My name is Barry. I retired out of the Army in 2021 and my career change cyber quest began with zero experience. Presently, I hold a BS and MS in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance at Western Governors University. I think the most important take away from this academic trek is knowing that what I know is, I don't know enough.
